## Griffin, the Book Bot

Griffin, the book bot is a simple command-line program that reads text from a
file and generates a report about the text. I am undertaking this mini project
as a fun learning experience.

### Usage

Put any text files in a directory called 'books/' and run
```sh
python main.py

# or if you have GNU Make
make run
```
